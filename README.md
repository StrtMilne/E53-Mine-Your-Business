Browser game brief:

MVP:

- Create a JavaScript 4x4 grid game modeled on 'mines'
- Users should be able to click on the grid and accumulate points each time they don't hit a mine
- The grid should display a loss and refresh once a mine is hit, resetting user score
- Display the user score

Extensions:

- Add a server to save user scores to a high score list
- Enable user to set the number of mines 
- Add sound responses to clicks

Advanced Extension:

- Add animations to flipped/flipping cards
